        "The properties to manipulate are given as AnimationStructure and can be nested, the input and output values as a AnimationSequence of AnimationKeys.",
        "They are combined as Animation and can be controlled by a ComponentAnimation to manipulate the other components of its container.",
        "Additionally, event-triggers may be installed with an animation to fire events when the input value passes the trigger input.",
        "To help navigating within an animation, labels may be defined."

      Setup: [
        "A cube with a transform- and an animator-component. An AnimationStructure references the x and y axis of the rotation of the transform",
        "A minimal sequence of two AnimationsKeys with adjustable input and output values, where input refers to time as is standard",
